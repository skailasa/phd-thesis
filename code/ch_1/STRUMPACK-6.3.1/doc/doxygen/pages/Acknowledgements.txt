The new, more robust version of the adaptive randomized HSS compression algorithm was developed in collaboration with Theo Mary from the UniversiteÃÅ de Toulouse.

The code for the STRUMPACK-sparse is based on the sequential code StruMF, originally developed by Artem Napov. We wish to thank people who sent us test problems and helped testing the code: Alex Druinsky, Yvan Notay and Shen Wang.
