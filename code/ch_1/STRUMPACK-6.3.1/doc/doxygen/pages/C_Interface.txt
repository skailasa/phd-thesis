/*! \page C_Interface C and Fortran Interfaces


## C Interface

The C interface is defined in the header file StrumpackSparseSolver.h
and is very similar to the C++ interface. For example usage see the
programs sexample.c, dexample.c, cexample.c and zexample.c in the
examples/sparse/ directory, for simple single and double precision
real and complex example programs. Note that since the STRUMPACK code
is written in C++, even when using the C interface you should link
with a C++ aware linker or link with the standard C++ library. For
instance when using the GNU toolchain, link with g++ instead of gcc or
link with gcc and include -lstdc++.


## Fortran Interface

A fortran module file is installed in the include folder under the
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX directory.  The use of this Fortran interface is
illustrated in examples/sparse/fexample.f90, in the examples folder.
The fortran module is build from the src/fortran/fortran.f90 file,
which is generated from the C interface in
src/StrumpackSparseSolver.h.

To use the STRUMPACK Fortran interface and link to the Fortran library
in an application, we recommend CMake. An example CMake project looks
like:

\code {.bash}
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13)
project(fexample VERSION 0.1 LANGUAGES Fortran)
find_package(STRUMPACK REQUIRED)
add_executable(fexample fexample.f90)
target_link_libraries(fexample PRIVATE STRUMPACK::strumpack)
\endcode

And then invoke CMake with the path to the STRUMPACK installation
folder set:

\code {.bash}
> export STRUMPACK_DIR=/some/path/STRUMPACK/install
> cd myapp
> mkdir build
> cd build
> cmake ../
> make
\endcode
