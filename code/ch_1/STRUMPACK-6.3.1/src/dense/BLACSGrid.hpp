  /**
   * \class BLACSGrid
   * \brief This is a small wrapper class around a BLACS grid and a
   * BLACS context.
   *
   * The main purpose of this wrapper is to handle the (global)
   * resource of BLACS grid, ie, creation and destruction, as well as
   * to encapsulate the BLACS interface into a single small piece of
   * code. This will hopefully make it much easier to at one point in
   * the near future get rid of ScaLAPACK and BLACS, and replace it
   * with SLATE.
   *
   * This class also stores (and owns) an MPIComm object. The BLACS
   * grid is a 2D grid, consisting of nprows x npcols processes, with
   * ranks assigned COLUMN MAJOR!!. However, the total number of
   * processes, P, can be larger than nprows x npcols, meaning some
   * processes are included in the MPIComm, but not in the grid, ie,
   * they are idle. Leaving some processes idle can give a grid with a
   * better aspect ratio, compared to using all available ranks,
   * leading to more scalable code.
   *
   * The MPIComm object can also be MPI_COMM_NULL, while P can still
   * be > 0. This is useful for getting info about a grid (the
   * layout), in which this rank is not active, for instance to know
   * to which rank to communicate.
