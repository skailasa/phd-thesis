gi# Global TODOs

- Introduction
    - Look at recent FMM advances over the past decade to properly cite in paragraph, beyond ones that are super prominent.
    - Do the citations section for FMM applications
    - dta re-use comment for direct calculation, might be helpful to have an arithmetic intensity estimate, like that in one of the yokota papers

- Review of FMM
    - Analytical derivation in 2D for multipole expansions and local evaluations, will need to look up.
    - Need to lookup 3D expansions in terms of spherical coordinates just for my revision purposes and exam and write a note about this.
    - kiFMM
        - MFS convergence properties
    - Oscillatory section
        - need to write clearly about diagonolisation but in words
        - can mention the MFS result, and how this could be used to re-use the kiFMM framework and crank up sampling required.
    - How exactly are H/H2 matrices related to FMM ideas? Where are they equivalent?
        - basically algebraic FMMs are more or less equivalent if a particular choice is taken for block cluster tree.
        - need to be able to spell out exactly the difference.

    - Computational structure
        - FMM flow diagram
        - break down kiFMM operations by computational complexity, as well as memory accesses required?
        - identify bottlenecks,

    - Review of software approaches,
        - need to finish literature review of FMM software that is available
        - need to describe exactly what is available, their stated aims, and where we fit in



1. Sort out papers for review on
    - parallel FMM
    - high frequency FMM
    - fast solvers and extensions of FMM
    - BIEs etc.

4.ii. Drafting of chapter headings for thesis
