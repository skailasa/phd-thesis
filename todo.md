# Global TODOs

Chapter 2:
- Finish all sections
- Reading left to do:
    - ped. intro to HF FMM, for complexity estimates (of both types) as I want these or similar in 2.1
    - HF FMM (analytic and ki) complexity estimates, and convergence properties.
    - H2, how are the approximations typically constructed? Linear algebra?
        - the review paper by Steffen Borm is good, have a look at the book again if there is anything I've missed.
    - I always forget HBS/HSS - kressner notes, and Martinsson book.

- Distributed memory
    - need to write up communication of ghost's complexity that I worked out for the old Lashuk paper, and contrast it with my own approach.

- Computational structure
    - maybe a short note on the arithmetic intensity (need the reference for this and roofline plots maybe, but its so common)

- Algorithm zoo:
    - if I have the main bits of the FMM I'm using spelled out by this point, it is good to place it in context of competing methods, that's why that table there is good.
    - I need to expand on the table though, it's not clear what those complexities are or where they come from. I need to write sentences to that effect.
    - It would be good to have a table also breaking down each approximation scheme by translation method instead of just one big one.

    - reading left to do:
        - go through the approximation schemes I'm not familiar with in this list of papers.
