Questions:

Mathematics

- Formulation of different FMM schemes (e.g. plane wave, cartesian expansion, chebyshev etc) other than my own.
    - tradeoffs in terms of convergence, interpolation error, computational burden.

- Formulation of integral equation problems for which FMM is applied
    - deriving basic BIEs for laplace, helmholtz, TH maxwell cases

- Properties of 2nd order PDE that make them amenable to integral equation formulation and therefore FMM

- What types of PDE are not amenable to this type of simulation, why?

- Linear algebra + Matrix computations
    - SVD (computing + properties)
    - Basic concepts of vector spaces
    - Sensitivity analysis
    - Basics of iterative methods
    - FFT algorithm form, structure, and implementation issues.
    - Iterative solvers, especially as they apply to BIEs that arise from 2nd order El PDE

Approximation theory
    - Interpolation schemes: Chebyshev vs MFS (choosing grid points and tradeoffs)
    - Quadrature schemes (tangential)
    - Basics of Potential theory

Computer Science

- Basics of parallel computing
- Architectures, memory hierarchies, heterogenous computing trade-offs
- SIMD, impact of ILP, and autovectorisation on software structure.
