<h1 align='center'> PhD Thesis </h1>

## Outline

The goal of this thesis was the implementation of a fully distributed, $O(N)$, fast-direct solver for the integral equations arising from Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism. To that end we've developed a software infrastructure for solving these problems in Rust, a promising young programming language with excellent properties for high-performance computational science. These codes are portable and malleable, and we demonstrate their scaling performance from local workstations to the petascale supercomputing clusters.
