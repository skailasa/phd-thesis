@article{malakhov2016python,
abstract = {Python is popular among numeric communities that value it for easy to use number crunching modules like [NumPy], [SciPy], [Dask], [Numba], and many others. These modules often use multi-threading for efficient multi-core parallelism in order to utilize all the available CPU cores. Nevertheless, their threads can interfere with each other leading to overhead and inefficiency if used together in one application. The loss of performance can be prevented if all the multi-threaded parties are coordinated. This paper describes usage of Intel{\textregistered} Threading Building Blocks (Intel{\textregistered} TBB), an open-source cross-platform library for multi-core parallelism [TBB], as the composability layer for Python modules. It helps to unlock additional performance for numeric applications on multi-core systems.},

abstract = {We describe a parallel fast multipole method (FMM) for highly nonuniform distributions of particles. We employ both distributed memory parallelism (via MPI) and shared memory parallelism (via OpenMP and GPU acceleration) to rapidly evaluate two-body nonoscillatory potentials in three dimensions on heterogeneous high performance computing architectures. We have performed scalability tests with up to 30 billion particles on 196,608 cores on the AMD/ CRAY-based Jaguar system at ORNL. On a GPU-enabled system (NSF's Keeneland at Georgia Tech/ORNL), we observed 30× speedup over a single core CPU and 7× speedup over a multicore CPU implementation. By combining GPUs with MPI, we achieve less than 10 ns/particle and six digits of accuracy for a run with 48 million nonuniformly distributed particles on 192 GPUs. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {A combination of hierarchical tree-like data structures and data access patterns from fast multipole methods and hierarchical low-rank approximation of linear operators from H-matrix methods appears to form an algorithmic path forward for efficient implementation of many linear algebraic operations of scientific computing at the exascale. The combination provides asymptotically optimal computational and communication complexity and applicability to large classes of operators that commonly arise in scientific computing applications. A convergence of the mathematical theories of the fast multipole and H-matrix methods has been underway for over a decade. We recap this mathematical unification and describe implementation aspects of a hybrid of these two compelling hierarchical algorithms on hierarchical distributed-shared memory architectures, which are likely to be the first to reach the exascale. We present a new communication complexity estimate for fast multipole methods on such architectures. We also show how the data structures and access patterns of H-matrices for low-rank operators map onto those of fast multipole, leading to an algebraically generalized form of fast multipole that compromises none of its architecturally ideal properties.},

@article{Ibeid2016,
abstract = {Exascale systems are predicted to have approximately 1 billion cores, assuming gigahertz cores. Limitations on affordable network topologies for distributed memory systems of such massive scale bring new challenges to the currently dominant parallel programing model. Currently, there are many efforts to evaluate the hardware and software bottlenecks of exascale designs. It is therefore of interest to model application performance and to understand what changes need to be made to ensure extrapolated scalability. The fast multipole method (FMM) was originally developed for accelerating N-body problems in astrophysics and molecular dynamics but has recently been extended to a wider range of problems. Its high arithmetic intensity combined with its linear complexity and asynchronous communication patterns make it a promising algorithm for exascale systems. In this paper, we discuss the challenges for FMM on current parallel computers and future exascale architectures, with a focus on internode communication. We focus on the communication part only; the efficiency of the computational kernels are beyond the scope of the present study. We develop a performance model that considers the communication patterns of the FMM and observe a good match between our model and the actual communication time on four high-performance computing (HPC) systems, when latency, bandwidth, network topology, and multicore penalties are all taken into account. To our knowledge, this is the first formal characterization of internode communication in FMM that validates the model against actual measurements of communication time. The ultimate communication model is predictive in an absolute sense; however, on complex systems, this objective is often out of reach or of a difficulty out of proportion to its benefit when there exists a simpler model that is inexpensive and sufficient to guide coding decisions leading to improved scaling. The current model provides such guidance.},

abstract = {This text introduces the following: (1) new regularized combined field integral equations (CFIE-R) for frequency-domain sound-hard scattering problems; and (2) fast, high-order algorithms for the numerical solution of the CFIE-R and related integral equations. Similar to the classical combined field integral equation (CFIE), the CFIE-R are uniquely-solvable integral equations based on the use of single and double layer potentials. Unlike the CFIE, however, the CFIE-R utilize a composition of the double-layer potential with a regularizing operator that gives rise to highly favorable spectral properties-thus making it possible to produce accurate solutions by means of iterative solvers in small numbers of iterations. The CFIE-R-based fast high-order integral algorithms introduced in this text enable highly accurate solution of challenging sound-hard scattering problems, including hundred-wavelength cases, in single-processor runs on present-day desktop computers. A variety of numerical results demonstrate the qualities of the numerical solvers as well as the advantages that arise from the new integral equation formulation. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},
