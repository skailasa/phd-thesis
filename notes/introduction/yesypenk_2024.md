- SKELFMM

- remove interaction list, only use neighbour interactions at each level

- relies heavily on a precomputation stage that constructs a tailored representation for a given geometry of points

- multilevel, doesn't rely on adaptive trees, no need for interaction lists of adaptive trees or v list
