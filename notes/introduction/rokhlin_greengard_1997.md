- Rokhlin and Greengard FMM with diagonal translation operators
    TODO: A new version of the fast multipole method ... 1997
    - split the interaction list into pieces contained in solid angles.
    - Use this space to find references to older papers on M2L optimisation especially for the analytical FMM.
    - Things like from Oliver Coulaud and the other French group who have a paper on BLAS vs FFT for analytical FMM (in 3D?)
