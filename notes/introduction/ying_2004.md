- Error estimation procedure for KiFMM
- What are the error behaviour of method of fundamental solutions (Barnett Betcke).
    - Fairly sure we can expect exponential convergence, however in the original paper use Nystrom rather than MFS for approximation of integrals, with different convergence behaviour.
