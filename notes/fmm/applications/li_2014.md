# A kalman filter powered by $\mathcal{H}^2$ matrices for quasi-continuous data assimilation problems

- kalman filters enable processing data as they arrive to continuously improve knowledge of a dynamical system.
- originally don't scale well with problem size, and have to store and operate on mxm matrix
