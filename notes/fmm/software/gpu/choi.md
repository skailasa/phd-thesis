A CPUâ€“GPU Hybrid Implementation and Model-Driven Scheduling of the Fast Multipole Method (2014)

- get close to 'realistic' peak performance' our of GPU

- develop a performance model

- Come up with some other kinda bullshit analytical performance model

- e.g. Model V list as memory bound, when it doesn't have to be, as shown by Us and Takahashi et. al
