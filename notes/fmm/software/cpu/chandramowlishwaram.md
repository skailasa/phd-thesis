Towards a Communication Optimal Fast Multipole Method and its Implications at Exascale
Aparna

First, we present lower bounds on cache complexity for key phases of the FMM and use these bounds to derive an- alytical performance models.

Secondly, using these models, we present results for choosing the optimal algorithmic tuning param- eter. Lastly,

- analytical tuning parameter derived for the FMM

- model the kiFMM
- fft based M2L

- non public software
