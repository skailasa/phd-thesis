An FMM Based on Dual Tree Traversal for Many-core Architectures


- Uses dual tree traversal instead of interaction lists

However, as future microarchitectures move towards less and less Byte/flop, the asymptotic constant of the arithmetic complexity becomes less of a concern. Therefore, the advantage in the communication complexity trumps the disadvantages as mentioned in the previous paragraph.
