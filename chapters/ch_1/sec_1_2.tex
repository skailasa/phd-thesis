\section{Introducing Rust for Scientific Software}\label{chpt:1:sec:2}

- We identified Rust as a suitable candidate language for our programming infrastructure.
- A little bit about Rust's unique properties
    - borrow checker
    - multi-paradigm
    - Cargo
        - contrast compiling in cargo wrt to diversity in C++
        - can maybe have figure from ver 1.0 of C++ vs Rust compiler tech
    - Traits system for code organisation
        - this can be mostly lifted from v 1.0, but should be shortened.
