- Lay out a sketch of the fast-algorithms for particle summation in terms of the flops/memory trade-off as in Yokota paper.

- Discuss other hierarchical schemes (H, H2 etc) and explain why FMM is preferred for our application.

- Explain why our version of FMM - semi-analytical - is preferred for programming.

- Explain what we can focus on to really accelerate in the semi-analytical FMM to program for exascale, with reference to field translations chapter.

- Discuss software construction for fast solvers, and what works and doesn't, what's currently available - and its shortcomings, and positives.
