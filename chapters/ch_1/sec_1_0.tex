- Brief motivation behind fast particle solvers, and where they fit in the scientific landscape, why are they useful?

- Brief survey on other uses of FMM (Kalman filtering - covariance matrices), lead into application for integral equations which is our motivating application

- Give a sense of the scale of improvement that these methods provide for solving this class of problems - making integral equations practicable computational techniques is a big deal.
