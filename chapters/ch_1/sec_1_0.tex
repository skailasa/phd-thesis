- Very brief motivation behind fast particle solvers, and where they fit in the scientific landscape, why are they useful?

- Brief survey on other uses of FMM (Kalman filtering - covariance matrices), lead into application for integral equations which is our motivating application

- Construct example of how this fits into integral equation solvers, ie. G1 A  G2, which is our motivating problem.
