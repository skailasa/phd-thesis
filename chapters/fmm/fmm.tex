\section{Kernel Independent Fast Multipole Methods}

- Review of the KiFMM and variants. Black Box FMM, Analytical FMM, Data Driven Techniques.

- Motivation for use from a software engineering and computational performance perspective.

- Data flow during the KiFMM.

- Performance characteristics and features of the kiFMM.

- Reflection on the kiFMM and modern software and hardware

The decades since its original presentation have seen the \acrshort{fmm} extended with related ideas which principally differ in how they represent interactions between distant clusters of particles typically referred to as \textit{algebraic} FMMs.


- Black Box vs Analytical

\section{Oscillatory Fast Multipole Methods}

- helmholtz fmm

- high frequency helmholtz FMM, out of scope of the thesis but can mention that they exist. Especially in the context of kiFMM approaches, what is the key difference? When does it apply (the directional low rank condition), where is there an additional loop? Why might this result in greater complexity

\section{Related Ideas}

- H Matrix and H2 matrices, and wider setting of the FMM and related problems.

- Abduljabbar thesis contains a nice summary I can read.


\section{The Fast Multipole Method's Computational Structure}

- Parallelism levels in computing (ILP (Pipelining, Superscalar, Speculative execution), Data level (SIMD, GPU), Thread level TLP (multithreading, simultaneous multithreading and hyper threading), Process level (symettric and asymettrixc multitprocessing), task level, Distributed Parallelism e.g. MPI and MapReduce)

- Only some of these are relevant for scientific computing

- Examine FMM data flow and relate to levels of Parallelism and which will be taken advantage of by us, and which are yet to be examined.

- What is the trend in hardware and why is the FMM a good kernel for scaling in future computer systems?

- What are the principal difficulties we will encounter? Data organisation, and communication costs in a distributed setting.

- What about good FMM software? Specialised kernels and substructures are required to be generically interfaced.

- What parts of this are addressed by this thesis and where?


\section{Review of Software Approaches}

- What software exists, and which approaches do they use?

- What are they optimised for, and what kind of performance do they promise?

- What are the trade-offs of each software

- Hardware targetted by each available software, what's missing?

- What's available, and what are the shortcomings?
