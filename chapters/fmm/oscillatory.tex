- helmholtz fmm

- high frequency helmholtz FMM, out of scope of the thesis but can mention that they exist. Especially in the context of kiFMM approaches, what is the key difference? When does it apply (the directional low rank condition), where is there an additional loop? Why might this result in greater complexity
