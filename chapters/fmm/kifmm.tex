\subsection{Motivation}

The decades since its original presentation have seen the \acrshort{fmm} extended with related ideas which principally differ in how they represent interactions between distant clusters of particles typically referred to as \textit{algebraic} FMMs.

- Review of the KiFMM and variants. Black Box FMM, Analytical FMM, Data Driven Techniques.

- Motivation for use from a software engineering and computational performance perspective.

\subsection{Algorithm}

- Approximation scheme via method of fundamental solutions, why do we expect certain convergence?
