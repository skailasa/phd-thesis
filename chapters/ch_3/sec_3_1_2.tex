\subsection{FFT Field Translations}

- Use M2L write-up

- offer a benchmark from exafmm-t, and a comment on how it works in terms of memory ordering

- Go through a new algorithm, and how this could help. I already have the discussion on transfer vectors from before and don't need to re-write it.
- offer a benchmark for same test problem using our dummy software, as this is the best I can do for now
- document the issue with memory ordering, and how this is rectified with the new algorithm.
