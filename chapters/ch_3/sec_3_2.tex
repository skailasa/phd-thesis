- Translation operators, what are they, and what are the different approaches currently used.

- What are the trade-offs of different approaches?

- Can I write some quick software for the quick comparison of translation operators - maybe in Python, on top of RustyTree? This would allow me to get some graphs to compare between approaches. If this is too much work, I will have to just compare the approaches in words.
