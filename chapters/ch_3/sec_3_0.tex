Fast direct solvers constitute a fast-matrix inversion - in contrast to the fast matrix-vector product of the FMM. This section describes ongoing work on the formulation of a new fast direct solver for solving low-medium frequency scattering problems that are described by the Helmholtz equation. This is a part of joint work developed in collaboration with researchers at the Flatiron Institute.
