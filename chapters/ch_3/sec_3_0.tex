\section{Distributed Octrees}

- Implementation details of octrees, and overview of current research.
    - how are we explicitly doing Morton encodings?
    - how are parallel trees constructed
        - global sorts for balancing
            - hyksort, and its importance

- Our octree algorithm and software
    - bottlenecks for fast algorithm implementation, and potential communicator optimisations
    - a single node benchmark at the very least, can defer multi-node one for now.
    - how are single/multinode tree implementations made easier with Rust traits?
