In this chapter we return to the motivating mathematical setting of this thesis, which is the numerical solution of elliptic PDEs using a boundary integral formulation. We begin in section \ref{sec:3_1} by providing an overview of fast direct solvers, which constitute a fast-matrix inversion - in contrast to the fast matrix-vector product of the FMM. This section proceeds to describe ongoing work on the formulation of a new fast direct solver for the scattering of low-frequency described by the Helmholtz equation, in collaboration with researchers at the Flatiron Institute. In section \ref{sec:3_2} we briefly discuss the gap in the literature in the understanding trade-offs between approaches for field translation, which as we saw in chapter \ref{chpt:1}, are critical for a performant implementations of fast algorithms. We conclude in section \ref{sec:3_3} with a brief summary of our target application, the application of our fast solver infrastructure to solve the scattering of electromagnetic waves which are described by Maxwell's equations.
