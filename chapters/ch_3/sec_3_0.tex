In this chapter we return to the motivating mathematical setting of this thesis, which is the numerical solution of elliptic PDEs using a boundary integral formulation. We begin in section \ref{sec:3_1} by providing an overview of fast direct solvers, which constitute a fast-matrix inversion - in contrast to the fast matrix-vector product of the FMM. This section proceeds to describe ongoing work on the formulation of a new fast direct solver for the scattering of low-frequency described by the Helmholtz equation, in collaboration with researchers at the Flatiron Institute. We conclude in section \ref{sec:3_3} with a brief summary of our target application, the application of our fast solver infrastructure to solve the scattering of electromagnetic waves which are described by Maxwell's equations.
