- Introduce the logic behind fast direct solvers via a short literature survey of the most popular methods.

- Introduce RS-S and skeletonization based approaches, why these are good (proxy compression, can re-use octree data structure, work with moderate frequency oscillatory problems, straightforward to parallelize)

- Introduce current state of the art work with Manas on proxy compression for Helmholtz problems.

- Conclude with future plans for fast direct solver using our Galerkin discretized BIE.
