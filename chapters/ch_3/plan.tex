Q. Active areas of development
    - field translations and comparison with state of the art
        - can take some benchmarks with dummy library
        - highlight the communication bound
        - can measure flop rate for translation library
        - can do roofline analysis of blas3 optimistion on modern
        processors for svd approach, though note that this is not
        necessarily the end of the road, as we have yet to examine
        the rank behaviour for different kernels.
        - small rank experiment for Laplace kernel
    - communicator optimisations in trees
        - what has been implemented in p4est, and can this help us?
