\subsection{SVD Field Translations}

- Can largely copy discussion from M2L write-up for specifics on how this works.

- BLAS3 optimisation for this algorithm, again taken from write-up.

- offer a benchmark for a test problem, which can be contrasted with FFT.

- Can this be improved by analytical considerations as well? What are they? The explicit rank behaviour of kernels is not known, even numerically, if this was investigated in more detail we could inform the design of an SVD based compression.
