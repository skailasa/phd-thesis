\section{Fast Multipole Methods}


- Introduction to idea and justification of fast multipole methods
- origin of idea, and difference with respect to similar ideas, and utility in the era of exascale computing.
- their research context and utility, and reason for why implementing them is still a research question.

- Review of FMM literature for software

- Go through the details of current and past projects, and detail exactly where in this context this thesis fits in.

- open questions on software side addressed by this thesis. How to make a framework that is usable, and open to extension.

- open questions on the algorithm side addressed by this thesis, with a software framework in hand can compare subcomponents of the algorithm.

\section{Kernel Independent Fast Multipole Method}

- Review of the KiFMM and variants.

- Motivation for use from a software engineering and computational performance perspective.

- Data flow during the KiFMM.

- Performance characteristics and features of the kiFMM.

- Reflection on the kiFMM and modern software and hardware
