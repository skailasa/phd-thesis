\section{Data Oriented Design with Rust Traits}

- Motivation, and review

- How do traits enable data oriented design.

\section{FMM Software As A Framework}

- Code generation for multiple targets

- Flexible backends


\section{High Performance Trees}

Bottlenecks in shared and distributed memory

Tree Construction approach and algorithms

Important implementation details
    - construction of interaction lists, neighbour finding.
    - construction of Morton encodings.
    - trade-offs of approach in shared and distributed memory
        - e.g. adaptive vs weakly adaptive trees.
        - problems with load balancing approach etc
    - justification
        - simplicity/works vs complex/private


\section{High Performance FMM Operators}

- Go through each operator of kiFMM and how it's been optimised, at a high level for M2L operators.
