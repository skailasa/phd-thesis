- Summarise pyexafmm paper, and what it hoped to discover - Can we use JIT compilers to build cse applications? Answer, probably not.

- Can largely copy from Numba section of paper, its pitfalls, as well as the section on PyExaFMM's API and parallelization strategies.

- Conclude with idea that an alternative is necessary, but going back to C++ isn't the right option.

- List what we ideally want from a language for scientific computing. Speed is one thing, but we also want maintainability, easy testing, building on different environments, Rust...
