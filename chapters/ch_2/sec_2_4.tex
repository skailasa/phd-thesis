- Case study for Rusty tree on different HPC environments and architectures. 

- briefly introduce algorithms (parallel sorting, tree construction).

- The novelty isn't the fact that it's a parallel octree, it's that it's one that you can use easily from Python, and deploy to different HPC environments and architectures.

Talk about the ease of writing a Python interface, and how this interoperability works. Talk about rSMPI project, it's important as this is an example that makes installation harder than it needs to be as it's a C shim - and that this is an example of a (relative) pitfall as an early adopter.

- contrast with existing libraries, their performance on different architectures, and how easy they are to install and edit - how malleable are they?
