- Current software projects, what they focus on, what their pitfalls are.

- Emphasise lack of integrated approach, and relatively few examples of open-source codes that are easy to build/deploy - i.e. aren't special research codes created to demonstrate a result.

- Why are we experimenting with Python and Rust? Where does the need for this come from, what has been done in the past?
