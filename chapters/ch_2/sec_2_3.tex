- Summary of Rust's core features for computational science.

- cargo, code organisation features, traits system, python interfacing.

- Rebuke common misconceptions: safety (bounds checking), lack of appropriate libraries for numerical data.

- Highlight what actually is missing, e.g. rust-native tools (linear algebra, MPI etc) - and what's being done about it.

- When is using rust appropriate? When is it not?

- Why are we turning to rust for this project?
