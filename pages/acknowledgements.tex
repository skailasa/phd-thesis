I leave the past five years transformed personally and professionally, the completion of this thesis simply wouldn't have been possible without the strong prevailing wind of emotional support from my family and the regularity of fun with my friends, sympathetic and dedicated teachers and colleagues both at UCL and across the world. It's been a pleasure to grow as a person and as a scientist with your support over these years which have been incredibly formative. Thank you all for giving me this opportunity.
