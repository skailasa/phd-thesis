The completion of this thesis simply wouldn't have been possible without the strong prevailing wind of emotional support from my family the regularity of fun with my friends, and the sympathetic and dedicated teachers and colleagues I met at UCL and across the world. Thank you \textit{all} for giving me this opportunity, I'm excited for what the future brings.
